    Beam OS (a.k.a. Chrome Beam) is a Google Chrome plugin (specifically
    a "packaged app") that allows the user to integrate multiple cloud
    services together creating a virtual hard disk or "Cloud Drive" with
    more available space. It also provides a handy "Save to Beam" option
    in the context menu to quickly upload anything selected via cursor
    to the cloud.
